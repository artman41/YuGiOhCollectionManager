When this card is Normal Summoned: You can target 1 Level 3 or lower \"Performapal\" or \"Odd-Eyes\" monster in your GY; Special Summon it, but it has its effects negated. Once per turn: You can target 1 card in your Pendulum Zone; Special Summon it, but it has its effects negated (if any), and if you do, immediately after this effect resolves, Synchro Summon 1 Synchro Monster using only that monster and this card.",
