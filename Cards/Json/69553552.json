  "description": "If you control a â€œF.A.â€ monster, this card cannot be destroyed by your opponentâ€™s card effects. When your â€œF.A.â€ monster whose Level is at least 5 higher than its original Level battles an opponentâ€™s monster and inflicts battle damage to them: banish 1 card from your hand, field or GY. You can only activate this effect of â€œF.A. Winnersâ€ once per turn. If 3 of your â€œF.Aâ€ Field Spells with different names are currently banished, and were all banished by the effect of â€œF.A. Winnersâ€, you win the Duel.",
