Once per turn: You can discard 1 \"D/D/D\" monster, then target 1 Level 6 or lower \"D/D\" monster you control; it gains 2000 ATK and DEF until the end of this turn (even if this card leaves the field).\n\n Monster Effect\n If this card in the Pendulum Zone is destroyed: You can target 1 \"D/D/D\" monster you control; return it to the hand, and if you do, place up to 2 face-up \"D/D\" Pendulum Monsters from your Extra Deck in your Pendulum Zones, but they cannot activate their Pendulum Effects this turn. You can only use this effect of \"D/D Savant Nikola\" once per turn.",
