(Xyz Materials attached to that monster also become Xyz Materials on this card.)  If Summoned this way, the following effect cannot be activated this turn. Once per turn: You can detach 2 Xyz Materials from this card; banish as many Special Summoned monsters your opponent controls as possible, then attach 1 of those banished monsters to this card as Xyz Material. If this face-up card on the field would be destroyed by battle or card effect, you can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card instead.",
